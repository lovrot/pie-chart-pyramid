A Shiny Application for the Pie Chart Pyramid
=============================================

This is a toy [Shiny app](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) to familarise myself with 
this web application framework. The app is deployed at 
[lovrot.shinyapps.io/pie-chart-pyramid](https://lovrot.shinyapps.io/pie-chart-pyramid).

The graph itself is a paraphrase of 
[flowingdata.com/2014/12/01/pie-chart-pyramid/](http://flowingdata.com/2014/12/01/pie-chart-pyramid/).
